# 3D Path Finder(Algorithm Visualization)

Check out the live app(https://hkryucr.github.io/3d-path-finder/)

3D Path Finder is an interactive algorithm visualization. This app allows you to select start and ending points, to choose different types of path finder algorithms the statistics, create random wall(s) and run the visualizer.

This year's World Happiness Report focuses on happiness and the community: how happiness has evolved over the past dozen years, with a focus on the technologies, social norms, conflicts and government policies that have driven those changes.

This tool allows you to explore the study, customize the statistics, and share the facts.

### Technologies
JavaScript (ES6)
Webpack
Babel
HTML5
CSS3

### Features
Users can interact with buttons and a board to choose different visualizing options
Users can randomly generate walls, move starting and ending points, and choose a type of algorithms
Users can reset the entire board and create a new path finder visualizer


### Future Plans
I plan on improving additional features as follows:

Additional path-finding algorithms - swarm algorithm, dijkstra algorithm, etc.
Customizing 3D View options - users can select x, y, and z angles for the board and tiles
